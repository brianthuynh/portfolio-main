                <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
                <p>Hi! My name is Brian Huynh and I am enrolled in DSC106 for the 2025 Winter Quarter. I am a student at UC San Diego majoring in Data Science and minoring in Cognitive Science. I have a deep interest in fields such as Sports Analytics and Computational Neuroscience. I aspire to work in those fields and be a part of a team that takes an ethical approach to help extract insights and uncover hidden patterns from data. Outside of data science, I've held teaching positions as a tutor and high school coach. I enjoyed every bit of it as it helped train my communication skills and develop an open-minded approach to how individuals learn. I am currently seeking opportunities in positions where I can leverage my skills and interests to make a meaningful impact.</p>
